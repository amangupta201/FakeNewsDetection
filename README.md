# FakeNewsDetection
It uses machine learning to build a model that can classify articles as real or fake based on their content. 
It uses a dataset of labeled articles (real or fake) to train a classifier, and then use the trained model to predict the labels for new articles.
It checks the veracity of the claims made in the article by fact-checking them against reliable sources. 
It uses python to automate the process of searching for the claims made in the article and checking them against a database of known facts.
